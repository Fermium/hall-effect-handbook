# Warnings

**Using high magnetic field require some caution:**

* You must avoid approaching any magnetizable object (clocks, electronic devices, screwdrivers...), which when brought too close may be permanently magnetized.

* A pinch hazard subsists if steel or other ferromagnetic material gets close to the magnets.

* Do not attempt to unscrew the magnets.

* The Magnets are brittle. A rapid shock with another magnet or ferromagnetic material may release shards dangerous for the eye.

* The apparatus **MUST NOT** be used by people with pacemakers.
