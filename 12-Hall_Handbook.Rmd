Experimental results consistently shows that the energy gap depends on temperature and for Germanium we can find in the literature the following empirical law:

$$
E_{ g }(T)=0.742-\frac { 4.8\cdot 10^{ -4 }T^{ 2 } }{ T+235 } \quad \quad [eV]
(\#eq:eGempiricalLaw)
$$


This may be approximated, in the high temperature region, by a linear law
as follows:

$$E_g (T) = A \cdot BT$$

where the constants $A$ is the value of $E_g$ *linearly extrapolated* to $T=0$:
$$E^0_g = A = 0.78eV$$

Since in the intrinsic region (high temperature) the resistance depends on the absolute temperature $T$ as $exp( \frac{E_G}{2kT})$, a plot of $ln( R )$ vs $\frac{1}{2 K T}$ using a linear approximation for $E_g(T)$ results in a straight line with slope $E^0_g$
