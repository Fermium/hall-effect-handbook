## The set-up for changing and measuring the sample temperature


The stainless-steel dewar can be filled of liquid nitrogen or a mixture of acetone and dry-ice (solid carbon dioxyde). The cold finger (the aluminum bar screwed into the base of the sample) is surrounded by the liquid nitrogen, allowing the sample to be cooled .

The temperature is measured by a type K (Chromel-Alumel) thermocouple thermally coupled to the sample. The small voltage generated by the thermocouple is amplified by an AD8495[^AD8495] integrated circuit. The output (roughly proportional to the temperature with a sensitivity of $\approx 5\frac { mV }{ \,^{\circ}\mathrm{K} }$ is amplified by a non-inverting amplifier (not shown in picture) to get $\approx 10\frac { mV }{ \,^{\circ}\mathrm{K} }$ and shifted to obtain $V_{out \, T}=2.5V$ at $273.15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{K}=0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. While the K type thermocouple is fairly linear in a small range near room temperature, it is not linear in the whole temperature range covered by the apparatus, as can be seen in Fig. \@ref(fig:seebeckNonlinearity).

In order to get a correct measurement it is necessary to compensate for the non-linearity (see Fig. \@ref(fig:seebeckNonlinearity)) of the thermocouple using the following polynomial:

$$\begin{equation}
t_{calc}=d_{ 0 }+d_{ 1 }E+d_{ 2 }E^{ 2 }+...+d_{ n }E^{ n }
(\#eq:compensatingPolynomial)
\end{equation}$$

where $E$ is the output voltage of the thermocouple in $mV$.

A fitting polynomial \@ref(eq:compensatingPolynomial) of the fifth order is sufficient, given the precision of our equipment.

The table \@ref(tab:kcoefftable) shows the polynomial coefficients obtained from a best fit of the NIST[^srdata] data tables.

Fig. \@ref(fig:NISTfit) shows the NIST $t(E)$ data for K thermocouple compared with the results obtained using eq. 24 and the coefficient of table 1, and the residual errors in the range ($-200< t \, [^{\circ}\mathrm{C}] <200$)

The voltage $E$ at the thermocouple junction can be obtained[^AD8495nist] from the following equation:

$$\begin{equation}
E=\frac { 1 }{ 2 } \frac {  V_{ outT }-{ V }_{ Ref }-{ V }_{ Offset } }{ Gain } 
(\#eq:voltageAtThermocoupleJunction)
\end{equation}$$


where $V_{outT}$ is the output of the instrument (on the front panel), $V_{Ref}=2.5V$ the voltage that indicates a temperature $T=0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, $V_{offset}$ is the error voltage at $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to achieve 125 mV at $25\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $Gain$ is the internal gain of the AD8495 amplifier.

Using the fitting polynomial  \@ref(eq:compensatingPolynomial) allows us to finally obtain the  temperature in Celsius:

$$\begin{equation}
t={ f }_{ comp }\left( E \right)
(\#eq:FcompE)
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}
t={ f }_{ comp } \left( \frac { 1 }{ 2 } \frac { V_{ out }-2.5-1.25\cdot 10^{ -3 } }{ 122.4 } \right)
(\#eq:ad8494Compensated)
\end{equation}$$

A digitally controlled resistive element (heater) is wound around the base of the sample, allowing to heath it up after reaching room temperature. The instruments automatically shuts down the heater if $t \ge 170\, \,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.
