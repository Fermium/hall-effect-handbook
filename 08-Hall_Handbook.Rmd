## Suggested procedure 

To obtain accurate measurements the best procedure is the following:


1. Connect the DB25 cable from the hub board mounted on the mechanics to the main unit
2. Choose a width for gap between the permanent magnets and measure the magnetic field B in the middle, using a gauss-meter. Place the sample far from the magnetic field and trim the balance-potentiometer to minimize the $V_H$ signal. Lock the potentiometer knob.
3. Place the sample in the middle of the gap. Choose a proper value for the current $I_b$ within a suggested 5-40 mA range, and select the proper gains for $V_H$ and $V_R$ channels. Note : the resistance at higher temperature may exceed the value at room temperature by a factor 2, and  also the $V_H$ signal increase with temperature.
4. Check that the $V_H$ value changes sign when rotating the sample of 180Â° around vertical axis. Choose the orientation that gives positive $V_H$.
5. Check and understand the mathsheet in the software NNG Logger.
6. Fill about half of the dewar with liquid nitrogen and wait until the liquid surface is quiet.
7. Insert the cold finger into the dewar (the PTFE dewar-cover should seat stable onto the dewar mouth, and the PTFE heater cover should be set with the hole hosting the pin protruding from the dewar-cover) as shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:ScrewDevice). Adjust the sample in the mid of the magnet-gap and start the data acquisition.
8. Open temperature vs time graph on NNG Logger. 
9. When the plot temperature vs time shows a slope close to zero, pause the data acquisition.
10. Empty the dewar (e.g. transferring the residual liquid nitrogen into another dewar), reposition the sample in the middle of the magnets-gap and start a new data acquisition for increasing temperature. 
11. When the temperature vs. time slope start approaching zero, switch ON the heater to full power.

To obtain precise measurements, at least one hour is required for the whole temperature sweep. 

Note: it is not suggested to keep liquid nitrogen inside the dewar while heating-up the sample: the temperature would rise more slowly and more humidity would condense onto the outer surface of the aluminum probe envelope. 

It is also useful to blow-off the frost in order to prevent water entering the probe envelope (this might affect the thermocouple's weak signal).
